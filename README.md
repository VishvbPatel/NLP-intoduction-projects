# NLP-intoduction-projects
This repository contains projects related to the NLP basics and preprocessing.
Here, in the "NLP word tokenizing and sentence tokenizing" file, NLTK library is used in word tokenizing and sentence tokenizing operation. 
And in, "NLP removing stop words from sentence" file, the operation of removing stop words has been done with the help of stopwords in NLTK library.
Both of the files contains basic preprocessing operations which are essential in NLP.
So, in the "stemming of word" file the operation of stemming has been performed on the sample words with the help of "PorterStemmer". 
Then in the "Part of Speech tagging", the speech tagging operation has been done with the help of "state_union" library from nltk.corpus and "PunktSentenceTokenizer" from nltk.tokenize library. Then sample_text and train_text has been added. "PunktSentenceTokenizer" has been applied to train_text and then the sample_text has been tokenized with the help of trained train_text. Then, with the help of word_tokenize and pos_tag libraries the words and tags has been seperated and printed.
Then, two codes of Chunking and Chinking has been added, the chunking is the process of grouping of the words on the basis of their tags in terms of nouns or verbs and chinking is the process of removal of something that is not required. So, first the libraries has been added and then  the train text and sample text has been added. First of all the tagging of the words has been done with the help of "PunktSentenceTokenizer" and "pos_tag". After successfully tagging, the chunking has been done with the help of "RegexpParser". And chinking is not a seperate process, it's just the not required words of phrases are defined that will not be included in the chunk And then printing the chunked words.
