# NLP-intoduction-projects
This repository contains projects related to the NLP basics and preprocessing.
Here, in the "NLP word tokenizing and sentence tokenizing" file, NLTK library is used in word tokenizing and sentence tokenizing operation. 
And in, "NLP removing stop words from sentence" file, the operation of removing stop words has been done with the help of stopwords in NLTK library.
Both of the files contains basic preprocessing operations which are essential in NLP.
So, in the "stemming of word" file the operation of stemming has been performed on the sample words with the help of "PorterStemmer". 
Then in the "Part of Speech tagging", the speech tagging operation has been done with the help of "state_union" library from nltk.corpus and "PunktSentenceTokenizer" from nltk.tokenize library. Then sample_text and train_text has been added. "PunktSentenceTokenizer" has been applied to train_text and then the sample_text has been tokenized with the help of trained train_text. Then, with the help of word_tokenize and pos_tag libraries the words and tags has been seperated and printed.
